HOW TO RUN A TEST FOR SPECIFIC DURATION 
Thread Group - Forever - Scheduler - Duration

Step 1 : Thread Group - make loop count = forever
Step 2: Select Scheduler checkbox
Step 3 : Add duration (sec)

———————————————————————————

HOW TO RUN PERFORMANCE TEST SEQUENTIALLY 
Test Plan - Run Thread Group Consecutively

Step 1 : Test Plan - select Run Thread Groups consecutively

———————————————————————————

HOW TO ADD WEBSITES SEQUENTIALLY TO A PERFORMANCE TEST
Thread Group - Forever - Scheduler - Duration + Startup Delay

Step 1 : Add duration (max) to first thread group - 30 sec

Step 2 : To consecutive thread groups add delay 

example (for a 30 sec test plan):
1st Thread Group : delay = 0 sec  |  duration = max duration of the test = 30 sec

2nd Thread Group : delay = 10 sec  |  duration = max - delay = 30 - 10 = 20 sec

3rd Thread Group : delay = 20 sec  |  duration = max - delay = 30 - 20 = 10 sec
