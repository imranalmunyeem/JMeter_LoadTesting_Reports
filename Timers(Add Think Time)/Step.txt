Purpose - to pause thread (v.user) for some time
   - to add delay between threads
   - to avoid over flooding the server and achieve real time          behaviour by pacing the load

 (to simulate v. userâ€™s THINK TIME)

Constant Timer
Uniform Random Timer

Random Delay Max
Constant Delay Offset

formula:
0.X * Random Delay Max + Constant Delay Offset

X : 0-9

example:
0.X * 100 + 0

0 - 99 milli sec
